Here are the outputs for R15 from the current output of the calculator:

here are the excel values:
	Scenario:	R15: Women from the general population considering COCs.																	
R15	We assume that the risk of pregnancies on combined oral contraceptives (COC) is 0.0595 (5.95%),  the risk of pregnancies not on treatment is 0.85 (85%), and the risk for VTE for a patient on combined oral contraceptives (COC) is 0.001225 (0.1225%) while the risk while not on treatment is 0.00035 (0.035%).																		
																			
																			
Rx:	When not testing 1000 patients for thrombophilia and  treating all of them,								1.225 VTE recurrences and 			59.5  pregnancies  will occur per year.							
Test:	When testing 1000 patients and not treating the 68.5 positives,  								0.9605 VTE recurrences and 			113.6493 pregnancies will occur per year.							
NoRx:	When not testing 1000 patients for thrombophilia and not treating any of them,  								0.35 VTE recurrences  and 			850 pregnancies will occur per year.							
Decision theory(1):			(Note: since the relative risk of VTE for combined oral contraceptives (COC), RR = 3.5 is larger than 1, the recommendations are reversed.																
	Patient's values and preferences				RV =	1			Acceptable regret (# of cases per 1000)				Rgo = 	5					
Rx: 	If the risk for VTE is below the treatment threshold (7.1667%), the best strategy is to not to test and to administer treatment.																		
Test: 	If the risk for VTE is between the testing threshold (42.2116%) and the treatment threshold (7.1667%), the best strategy  is to test and treat if the test is not positive.																		
NoRx: 	If the risk for VTE is above the testing threshold (42.2116%), the best strategy is to not to test and not to treat.																		
Decision theory conclusion:														Decision theory (EUT) agrees with ASH thrombophilia guidelines. According to acceptable regret theory the acceptable strategy is:   Rx.					
	Since the overall risk for VTE recurrence (0.035%) is less than treatment threshold, the best strategy is to not to test and recommend administering  treatment.
